### Common Questions

#### Q: What is Spec-Driven Development?
A: Spec-Driven Development is a methodology where specifications become executable, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them. See our [methodology documentation](docs/spec-driven.md) for details.

#### Q: How do I initialize a new project?
A: Use the CLI tool:
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>
```

#### Q: What AI assistants are supported?
A: The spec kit supports Claude, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Qwen CLI, and OpenCode. Specify with the `--ai` flag during initialization.

#### Q: Can I use this methodology with other projects?
A: Yes! The Spec-Driven Development methodology can be applied to any software project. This photo album organizer is just one example implementation.

#### Q: How do I contribute to the project?
A: Please read our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed information on how to contribute.
