# Photo Album Organizer Application - Implementation Plan

## Project Setup

- Initialize the project using Vite for fast development and build.
- Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible.
- Limit external libraries to only those absolutely necessary (e.g., SQLite integration).

## Core Features

### 1. Album Management
- Create albums grouped by date.
- Store album metadata (name, date, photo list) in a local SQLite database.
- Prevent nested albums.

### 2. Photo Handling
- Allow users to add photos to albums from local storage.
- Display photos in a tile/grid interface within each album.
- Do not upload images; keep them local.

### 3. Drag-and-Drop Reorganization
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality on the main page to re-organize albums.
- Update album order in the SQLite database.

## Data Storage
- Use SQLite for local metadata storage (albums, photo info).
- Store image file paths or references, not the images themselves, in the database.

## UI/UX
- Responsive, modern design using vanilla CSS.
- Main page: shows albums grouped by date, supports drag-and-drop.
- Album page: shows photo tiles, supports adding/removing photos.

## Development Steps
1. Scaffold Vite project.
2. Set up SQLite database integration (consider using sql.js for browser-based SQLite).
3. Build main page UI for album display and drag-and-drop.
4. Implement album creation, grouping, and metadata storage.
5. Build album view with photo tile interface.
6. Implement local photo selection and preview.
7. Connect UI actions to SQLite database operations.
8. Test all features for usability and performance.

## Next Steps
- Update the specification and plan as requirements evolve.
- Begin implementation following this plan.
